    - title: Scope
      text: Eclipse Tractus-X aims at the development of systems in support of the Catena-X network, with focus on quality management, logistics, maintenance, supply chain management and sustainability. In the initial proof-of-concept phase, Eclipse Tractus-X explores possible implementation options for the defined application areas which have been jointly defined. With the help of a networked data infrastructure, these application areas can significantly help to boost productivity and improve sustainability along future value chains. Applications supporting production and development are planned for future phases. The data network will create an important starting point for the industry to respond more efficiently to the challenges of digital transformation and to make better use of the opportunities offered by digitalisation.

    - title: Details
      text: The companies involved want to increase the automotive industry’s competitiveness, improve efficiency through industry-specific cooperation and accelerate company processes through standardization and access to information and data. A special focus is also on SMEs, whose active participation is of central importance for the network’s success. That is why Catena-X has been conceived from the outset as an open network with solutions ready for SMEs, where these companies will be able to participate quickly and with little IT infrastructure investment. Tractus-X is meant to be the PoC project of the Catena-X alliance focusing on parts traceability.
